                    <p>Sripathi Panditaradhyula Balasubrahmanyam (4 June 1946 – 25 September 2020), also referred to as
                        S. P. Balu or SPB, was an Indian musician, playback singer, music director, actor, dubbing
                        artist and film producer who worked predominantly in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Hindi and
                        Malayalam.
                        Affectionately called as ‘Balu’ in his friends’ circle, SPB made his singing debut in 1966 with
                        the Telugu movie Sri Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna, and went on to sing over 40,000 songs in as many
                        as 16 languages including Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, and Hindi.</p>
                    <p> He also won the Guinness World Record for recording the highest number of songs by a singer.</p>

                    <p>He bagged six National Film Awards for Best Male Playback Singer for his songs in four different
                        languages (Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Hindi), as well as 25 Andhra Pradesh state Nandi Awards
                        for his work in Telugu cinema, apart from numerous other state awards from Karnataka and Tamil
                        Nadu.

                        In addition, he also garnered six Filmfare Awards. In 2012, he received the state NTR National
                        Award for his contributions to Indian cinema. In 2016, he was honored with the Indian Film
                        Personality of the Year consisting of a Silver Peacock Medal.</p>

                    <p>He was a recipient of civilian awards Padma Shri (2001) and Padma Bhushan (2011). On September
                        25, 2020, he died in MGM Hospital due breathing difficulties, even though he recovered from
                        COVID-19.</p>
                    <h3>Singing career</h3>
                    <h3>Beginnings: 1960s–1970</h3>

                    <p>He recorded his first Tamil song “Athaanodu Ippadi Irundhu Eththanai Naalaachu”, a duet with L.R.
                        Eswari in the music direction of M. S. Viswanathan for the film Hotel Ramba, which never got
                        released. Other early songs he sang were duets with P. Susheela, “Iyarkai Ennum Ilaya Kanni” in
                        the 1969 film Shanti Nilayam , starring Gemini Ganesh, and “Aayiram Nilavae Vaa” for MGR in
                        Adimaippenn . His first song with S. Janaki was “Pournami Nilavil Pani Vizhum Iravil” in
                        Kannippenn . He was then introduced to the Malayalam film industry by G. Devarajan in the film
                        Kadalppalam.</p>

                    <p>He has the rare distinction of rendering the most songs in a single day by any singer. He
                        recorded 21 songs in Kannada for the composer Upendra Kumar in Bengaluru from 9 am to 9 pm on 8
                        February, 1981. Futhermore, he also recorded 19 songs in Tamil and 16 songs in Hindi in a day,
                        which is a notable achievement and a record.</p>

                    <p>He established a prolific career. “There were days when I used to record 15 to 20 songs, but only
                        for Anand-Milind. And I would take the last flight back to Chennai,” SPB said.</p>

                    <p>In the 1970s, he also worked with M. S. Viswanathan in Tamil movies for actors such as M. G.
                        Ramachandran, Sivaji Ganesan and Gemini Ganesan. He recorded duets with P. Susheela, S. Janaki,
                        Vani Jayaram and L. R. Eswari. Balasubrahmanyam’s association with Ilaiyaraaja began even before
                        Ilaiyaraaja came to the cine field. In those days, SPB used to sing in towns and villages all
                        over south India and Ilaiyaraaja, then an unknown harmonium and guitar player accompanied SPB by
                        playing in his concerts.</p>

                    <h3>International recognition: 1980s</h3>

                    <p>Balasubrahmanyam came to international prominence with the 1980 film Sankarabharanam. The film is
                        considered to be one of the best films ever to emerge from the Telugu film industry. Directed by
                        K. Vishwanath, the film’s soundtrack was composed by K.V. Mahadevan, and led to an increase in
                        the usage of Karnatak music in Telugu cinema. Not a classically trained singer, he used a “film
                        music” aesthetic in recording the songs. Balasubrahmanyam received his first National Film Award
                        for Best Male Playback Singer for his work. His first work in Hindi films was in the following
                        year, in Ek Duuje Ke Liye (1981), for which he received another National Film Award for Best
                        Male Playback Singer.</p>

                    <p>Balasubrahmanyam began to record more songs in Tamil, especially for Ilaiyaraaja with S.Janaki,
                        the trio considered to be highly successful in the Tamil film industry from the late 1970s and
                        throughout the 1980s. The songs were based on classical music, such as in Saagara Sangamam
                        (1983), for which both Ilaiayaraaja and S.P.B won National Film Awards, Swathi Muthyam (1986)
                        and Rudraveena (1988) which again won National Awards for Ilaiyaraaja and Balasubrahmanyam.</p>

                    <p>In 1989, Balasubrahmanyam was the playback singer for actor Salman Khan in the blockbuster Maine
                        Pyar Kiya . The soundtrack for the film was very successful and he won a Filmfare Award for Best
                        Male Playback Singer for the song Dil Deewana . For much of the next decade, Balasubrahmanyam
                        continued as the “romantic singing voice” on the soundtracks of Khan’s films.</p>

                    <p>Notable among these was Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! which became the all time highest-grossing Hindi
                        film, and Balasubrahmanyam’s duet with Lata Mangeshkar, “Didi Tera Devar Deewana”, was very
                        popular. This solidified Balasubrahmanyam as one of the biggest playback singers in India. SPB
                        was identified as Salman Khan’s voice in the 90s, just like Kishore Kumar became Rajesh Khanna’s
                        voice through the 70s.</p>

                    <p>Association with other composers, including A.R. Rahman: 1990s</p>

                    <p></p>In the 1990s, he worked with composers such as Vidyasagar, M. M. Keeravani, S. A. Rajkumar
                    and Deva among others, but his association with A.R.Rahman turned out be a major success.</p>

                    <p></p>Balasubramanyam’s association with Hamsalekha began after the latter’s successful venture
                    Premaloka in Kannada. Balasubramanyam sung the most songs for Hamsalekha in Kannada. He received his
                    fourth National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song “Umandu Ghumandu” from the
                    Kannada film Ganayogi Panchakshari Gavayi (1995), which was a Hindustani classical music-based
                    composition by Hamsalekha.</p>

                    <p></p>Balasubrahmanyam recorded three songs for A. R. Rahman in his debut film Roja. He began a
                    long time association with Rahman since then. Other popular songs include “July Maadham” from
                    Pudhiya Mugam , which also marked the debut of singer Anupama, “Mannoothu Manthayilae” from Kizhakku
                    Cheemayile which was a folk number and he almost sang all songs in the musical love story Duet and
                    “Thanga Thaamarai” from Minsara Kanavu which fetched him the sixth and latest of his National Film
                    Award for Best Male Playback Singer till date.</p>

                    <h3>Cementing his legacy: 2000s–2020</h3>

                    <p>In 2013, Balasubrahmanyam recorded the title song for Chennai Express , singing for the lead
                        actor Shahrukh Khan, under the music direction of Vishal-Shekhar. He returned to Hindi film
                        music after being away from it for 15 years.</p>
